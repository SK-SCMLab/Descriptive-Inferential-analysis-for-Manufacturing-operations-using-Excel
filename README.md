# üê± Descriptive-Inferential-analysis-for-Manufacturing-operations-using-Excel
This repository showcases practical examples of using Microsoft Excel for multivariate and regression-based analytics in a manufacturing operations setting. The dataset simulates production parameters across multiple machines and products. It includes:

1. Multi-variate analysis
2. Correlation
3. Regression analysis
4. Residual analysis
5. Confidence Interval
6. Prediction interval

## üê≠ Multi-variate analysis
Multi-variate analysis examines more than two variables simultaneously to understand complex relationships. It is used to:
- Analyze variation in a process
- Identifies investigation areas
- Breaks downs the variations into component families
- Multi-variate analysis is used when you have multiple discrete XŒî (like workshift, operator, plant location) and YŒî is continuous (like material length or resource cycle time)

### ü¶ä Classification of variation sources
Multi-variate anaylsis classifies variation sources into three major component types:
1. *Positional*
    - Deals with variations within a single unit where variation is due to location
    - Eg: Pallet stocking in a truck, variation observed from cavity-to-cavity within a mold, region of country and line on invoice

2. *Cyclical*
    - Focuses on variations among sequential repetitions over a short time
    - Eg: Every n·µó ∞ pallet broken, batch-to-batch variation, lot-to-lot variation, invoice received day-to-day, and amount of activity week-to-week

3. *Temporal*
    - Handles variations which occur over longer periods of time
    - Eg: Process drift, performance before and after breaks, seasonal and shift based differences, month-to-month closings and quarterly returns
